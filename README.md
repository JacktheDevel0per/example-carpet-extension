# Example Carpet Extension



Replace the MODID Strong in the ExampleServer (and rename it) to your own. 
this is meant as a guide, so you can remove the `flyingPigs` rule, as it is just an example.
`flyingPigs` shows a good practice wih mixin grouping. It is your mod though, you can do what you wish and structure it how you wish.




## License

You can basically use whatever license as long as it is permitted by carpet mod.

```I am not sure what is possible by me having the current license and if there is a problem I can change it (hopefully I can do that)```



## Building

run 

on windows `gradlew build`
on linux `./gradlew build`

the builds should show up in `build/libs/`
